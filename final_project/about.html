            <h2>Why is fast fashion a problem?</h2>
            <p>
                If you were to ask someone what fast fahsion was, chances are they would probably have no idea what it
                is.
                Fast Fashion is an exponentially growwing issue that started about 20 years ago. The price of clothing
                became
                less expensive which encouraged people to by more clothes. However, the drop in price effected the
                qulaity of
                the clothes making them less durable. The poor quality of the clothes made it so people would throw out
                their
                clothes more often which added to the alreayd immense waste problems through out the world. Fast Fashion
                also
                has effects of the people making the clothes. In many underdeveloped countries, people are desperate to
                find work
                to provide for themesleves and their familes. Many find jobs at the clothing companies where they are
                forced to
                work in terrible conditions and only make around $10 a day.
            </p>

            <h2>How can you avoid fast fashion?</h2>
            <p>
                One of the best ways to avoid fast fasion, or to lessen it's reprecussions is to by used clothes. If
                that is not
                an option for you, or you would like to support small clean business, make sure you research into your
                clothing companies.
                Some clothing brands to avoid would be:
                <ul>
                    <li>American Eagle</li>
                    <li>Shein</li>
                    <li>Romwe</li>
                    <li>H&M</li>
                    <li>Boohoo</li>
                    <li>Forever21</li>
                    <li>Zara</li>
                    <li>Victoria's Secret</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Why is Phoenix Clothing Co a good option for me?</h2>
            <p>
                At Phoenix Clothing Co. we strive to use the cleanest materials. Organic Cotton is the main material in
                all of our
                clothing. By using organic materials, our clothes are hypo-allergenic for most people and also super
                comfy We also
                pay those who create our clothes a fair wage and give them free range to design clothes the way they see
                fit. By
                allowing our designers to deisgn their own clothes, we are encouraging their creativity while also
                supporting
                their businesses. We also allow our designers to incoporate thrifed clothes into their designs so that
                we are not
                producing as much waste as other clothing companies. Re-using clothes is one of the best ways to reduce
                waste and
                battle fast fashion. Just like the mythical phoenix is reborn after if dies, we belive that clothes can have
                that same oppurtunity; to be given a new life.

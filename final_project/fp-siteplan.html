        <h2>Site Plan</h2>
        <p>
            Excessive waste is a big problem throughout the world. A big part of that waste is plastic, 
            but another part that not many people are aware of is clothes. One of the biggest influences 
            on clothing waste is fast fashion. Fast fashion is the term for cheaply made clothes that are 
            produced quickly to consumers who then wear them once or twice and then throw them away. As 
            if throwing away clothes was bad enough, the working conditions and wages of the people making 
            the clothes is even worse. I want to build a clothing company that focuses on creating clothes 
            that are long-lasting and environmentally friendly.

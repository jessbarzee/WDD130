       <p>
           Hello! My name is Jessica Hansen. I am from Rexburg, Idaho but am currently living in Provo, Utah.
           My major is Applied Technology, although I used to be an Elementary Education major. I love music
           and have played the violin and piano for 15+ years. My favorite type os study music is soundtrack music.
           I <strong>especially</strong> love the soundtrack from the Narnia movies. Food is also a big part of my
           life. My parents taught all six of their kids hoe to cook, and we take what we eat very seriously. My
           husband thinks I am picky, but I am really more picky abour the quality of the ingrediants of my food.
           my favorite foods are Indian and Italian.
